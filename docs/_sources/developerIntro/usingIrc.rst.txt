Using IRC
=========

`IRC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat>`_ is used as the project's main tool for direct communication. 
Many users connect and let themselves idle in a channel like :code:`#terasology` on the `Freenode IRC Network <https://freenode.net/>`_. So please do not feel people ignoring you if you do not get an immediate response. 
Some patience may be needed, as not everyone will watch for new messages every moment.
For a guaranteed response or topics with long-term discussions, the `forum <http://forum.terasology.org/>`_ will be a better.

You can join via webchat in a browser at the community page via http://forum.terasology.org/chat/ or directly at https://webchat.freenode.net/. 
Just enter your desired nickname and in the second case :code:`#terasology` for the channel to join.

IRC User Setup
--------------
For a more serious setup with IRC, you need a dedicated client and to properly register and account at freenode.

- Pick a client - many are available, even as browser plugins for Firefox and Chrome.
- Connect to :code:`chat.freenode.net`, see http://freenode.net/kb/answer/chat for more details.
- IRC generally dumps you in a system channel and expects you to use slash commands or menus for interaction.
   
  - Make sure any options in your client are set with your right name, nick, desired starting channel (:code:`#terasology`), etc.
  - You can change your nickname via :code:`/nick [nickname]`.
  - If you want to safeguard your nickname / account, register it via :code:`/msg nickserv register [password] [email]`.
    This will send you an email with a verification command you have to enter in order to verify your account.
  - To re-identify yourself to the server on each login, you may have to enter a command like :code:`/msg nickserv identify [password]` - most clients will allow you to automatically issue that on startup.
  - For additional help, enter :code:`/msg nickserv help`.
   
Gooey
-----
Gooey is our friendly local IRC bot and is waiting for orders in the :code:`#terasology` channels, at least most of the time :)
It is based on `Hubot <https://hubot.github.com/>`_  and it's sources lives at https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Gooey.

For help with Gooey simply enter :code:`.help` in :code:`#terasology` on Freenode, or even open a private message with the bot and use plain :code:`help` to interact more quietly.
