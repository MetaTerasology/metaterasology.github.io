Quick Start
===========

If you are only interested in playing the game or hosting a server without own development, you can switch directly to the :doc:`Playing </playing/playing>` section.

For smaller contributions, like small typo fixes or readme updates, you can use the :ref:`Light Workspace Setup<light_workspace_setup>`, based on GitHub tools and direct file editing.

More elaborated engine development or module development is better done on a full workspace setup with a programming IDE. Terasology supports either an :ref:`IntelliJ Workspace Setup <ide_intellij>` or an :ref:`Eclipse IDE Workspace Setup<ide_eclipse>`.

We also recommend to `introduce yourself on the forum <http://forum.terasology.org/forum/contributor-introductions.7>`_ and/or :doc:`visit us on IRC </developerIntro/usingIrc>` and let us know what you would like to do.
You can find first issues to work on in the `engine issue tracker <https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/issues>`_. The `Bite-size <https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/labels/Bite-size>`_ category bundles issues estimated for some hours of work.
`Mentor-size <https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/labels/Mentor-size>`_ issues are doable in some weeks, with assistance from a casual mentor.

For a better understanding of the general ideas behind the core architectures, the :doc:`Concepts </concepts/concepts>` section is worth a look. More detailed guides for special topics are available in the :doc:`Developer Guides </developing/developing>` area.

Code conventions, the general contribution workflow on GitHub and related topics are available in the :doc:`Conventions and Workflow </workflow/workflow>` section.
